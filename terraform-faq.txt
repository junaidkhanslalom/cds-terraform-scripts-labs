Terraform State- known state, is a file .tfstate 
desired-known-actual 

Why do we known state? 
- state purpose: Mapping to a real world, store mapping between, objects and objects in cloud
- for every AWS resource, you can add target
- state purpose: Performance, talking to resource on cloud, cache helps, tfstate is a cache that gives where detail is stored

Best practice, to have different number of projects, for single project. 
Do new projects for different projects. 
Best Practice - Group Resources have similar lifecycles and create Seperate Terraform projects for them
